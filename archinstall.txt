This has been a STRUGGLE, but I finally have wifi working so here is a little recap of how I did it so that I never forget.

1. rmmod all the modules i.e. wl ssb b43 bcma.

2. modporbe wl.

3. systemctl restart iwd to make it recognize the changes that I just made.

4. iwctl to start the interface.

5. station list to see what interfaces are up.

6. station wlan0 scan to scan wireless networks around me.

7. station wlan0 get-networks to list all the wireless networks around me.

8. station wlan0 connect rice to connect to the 'rice' wifi.

9. exit iwctl and ping a website to see if it worked.
